Ticket 2

1. Back to the End User osTicket URL (http://localhost/osTicket), click 'Open a New Ticket' at the top of the bar.

We will use the "Karen" account. Fill in the following sections:
- Email Address: karen@lognpacific.com
- Full name: Karen
- Phone Number: 5038884757
- Help Topic: General Inquiry / Other
- Issue Summary: "accounting department needs adobe upgrade, broken".
- Details: "It looks like many people in the account department can't use their adobe software".

3. Click on the new ticket that was just created. Read the issue summary and description and observe the properties as a Help Desk Agent (John).
- When reviewing the issue, the title and explanation seem hard to understand. It may not be necessary to upgrade the Adobe softwareâ€”it simply might not be usable for another reason. This calls for further investigation.
In this mock scenario, I respond to Ken by asking: "What exactly do you mean by 'many people in the accounting department can't use their Adobe software'?"
Ken clarifies that "only two people in the accounts department are unable to use Adobe Reader." This clarification helps narrow down the issue, allowing us to identify the specific scope of the problem and move on to the next step.

4. Navigate to the 'Post Reply' section. Respond to the ticket with a possible explanation of the issue and begin investigating to confirm whether this is the actual cause. My reply will be:
- "Customer states only 2 people in the accounting department are unable to open and use Adobe reader. I have asked the customer to conduct restarts, he will call back after lunch."
- Click 'Post Reply', refresh the ticket and you should see that it has been updated in the ticket history.

5. Letâ€™s assume lunch is over and the customer has responded, confirming that a restart resolved the issue and everything is now working correctly and there's no problems.

Post another reply in the Ticket Thread:
- "Customer states that restart fixed issue, closing out ticket".

End Users osTicket URL:
http://localhost/osTicket 


--------------------------------------------------

Set Properties to all the tickets; do SEV-A (SysAdmins last), observe ticket becomes inaccessible
Switch to admin panel and assign yourself View-access to Sys Admins
Switch to agent panel and observe the escalated ticket
Observe that you can no longer make changes to it

Solve all of the tickets
Explain in most ticketing systems (probably this one too) there is an email capability so every time you update the ticket, the user gets a copy and they can respond

Explain ticket intake IRL:
Sometimes tickets get created via phone, chat app, email, web form, or maybe even you run into someone in your hall or they roll up on you at your desk.
A lot of the time people will randomize you and try to get you to fix stuff on the spot. Itâ€™s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do. (metrics are important)

Finishing up and additional practice
Obviously there is much more to this product that covered here
Encourage the use and exploration of the email feature
Do this lab a few more times, enough times where youâ€™re able to implement it with this simple checklist. This will build your intuition.
Talk about Technical skill pillar
Re-touch on technical ability and re-doing the lab several times
